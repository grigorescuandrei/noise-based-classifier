## Description
The proposed Perlin noise-based classifier is a supervised binary classifier that is intended to use genetic algorithms (or other suitable means for optimization) to evolve a set of parameters in order to match the landscape generated by an n-dimensional Perlin noise with that of a given problem, so that values below a threshold represent one class and values above that threshold represent the other class.

Given a binary classification problem for which the inputs represent a vector with n numerical values, the parameters that constitute the solution are the following:
 - ``seed``: number - random number generator for noise, can be used for a strong mutation of the solution
 - ``octaves``: number - positive integer representing the number of Perlin Noise layers (or turbulence), can be used for finer details in map
 - ``threshold``: number in interval [0,1] - threshold for classification
 - ``scale1``: number - scaling factor across first noise dimension
 - ``offset1``: number - offset term across first noise dimension
 - ...
 - ``scaleN``: number - scaling factor across n-th noise dimension
 - ``offsetN``: number - offset term across n-th noise dimension
 - ``zOffset``: number - offset term across (n+1)-th noise dimension, an additional dimension used to sample a slice with features continuous in this dimension, used for weak mutation of the solution

 Other parameters can be added in order to manipulate the noise, such as rotation or turbulence.

Inputs will then be classified by calculating the value of the Perlin noise in the point represented by the individual's input vector, which should return a value loosely constrained in [0, 1], depending on Perlin noise implementation. This value will be compared with the threshold in order to determine the class.
